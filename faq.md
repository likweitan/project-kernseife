# Frequently Asked Questions / Known Issues

## Why can't I select/delete the uploaded classification File in the ALV Grid of ZKNSF_CLASSIFICATION_MANAGR?
If you are using the Java GUI (e.g. on MacOS) this is a known issue we can't fix.
See more details in this [Github Issue](https://github.com/SAP/project-kernseife/issues/16)

## Why can't I navigate to the finding object (Error: There is no navigation information available)?
This is a known bug and there is a [Note](https://me.sap.com/notes/3623342) to fix it.
Alternativly you might want to start using ATC in ADT instead of GUI ;)

## Why are there check failures and dumps due to ITAB_DUPLICATE_KEYS?
Please check this [issue](https://github.com/SAP/project-kernseife/issues/19).
