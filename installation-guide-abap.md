# How to install the Kernseife ATC Check

> [!CAUTION]  
> As this check is based on the "Usage of APIs" Check, it is necessary to have [SAP Note 3565942](https://me.sap.com/notes/3565942) implemented in your system.
> The current Version of Kernseife (v1.3.2) is tested with *v19* of the note.
> Lower Versions of the Note will only work with lower versions of Kernseife, but it is always recommended to use the latest version of both.

## Import the Kernseife ATC Check into target system (using [abapGit](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit))
Run the standalone version of abapGit using transaction:
```bash
ZABAPGIT
```

or executing the report (run transaction SE38) in:
```bash
ZABAPGIT_STANDALONE
```

You can find the lastest version of the standalone report here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abapGit/build/main/zabapgit_standalone.prog.abap

In abapGit click on "New Offline" to add a new repository. Enter the repo name KERNSEIFE and create a new package $KERNSEIFE and click on "Create Offline Repository".

In the new offline repository click on "Import zip" and upload the file you downloaded [here](https://github.com/SAP/project-kernseife/releases/latest/download/import.zip)

After the .zip was imported you need to press "Pull". This opens a dialog where you have to confirm the objects to be imported. 
If you used the Package name starting with $, it will be a Local Package and no transport is needed.
Otherwise you need a Workbench Transport Request.
As we normally don't want to run code-checks in Quality or Production, we recommend using a Local Package.

## Enable Kernseife Check Variant for ATC
After importing the the repository and creating the configuration files, the ATC check must be imported in ABAP Code inspector.
Open Transaction `SCI` (Code Inspector) and click in the top bar on Utilities => "Import Check Variants"

After that you can confirm the succesfull import by clicking on "Code Inspector => Management of => Checks".

The checks for Kernseife should now appear in this list.
First you need to select the Category (ZKNSF_CL_CI_CATEGORY) and save.
Afterwards you can select the Check (ZKNSF_CL_API_USAGE) and save.
This requires a Workbench Request which can be deleted afterwards, in case you don't want to transport the Checks downstream.

## Upload Classification Json
Execute Report:
```bash
ZKNSF_CLASSIFICATION_MANAGR
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07e5d511-1d64-4edf-a83a-4d8b2f3f05a0)

Click on "Upload Classic API File".
Select the Classification Json File.

As the main purpose is to create a custom classification, we encourage you to leverage the CAP application to create a classification JSON file according to your needs. Still, we offer a [default classification file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAP/project-kernseife/refs/heads/main/defaultClassification.json).
**Remark:** This file is purely based on the Cloudification Repository as of 2025-05-21. It is not the "best" or "right" classification, but a starting point that you can begin your Kernseife installation.

## Create Check Variant

Go to Transaction SCI and create a new check variant.
We recommend to copy the standard variant ABAP_CLOUD_DEVELOPMENT_3TIER as a base.
Make sure the new Variant is a public one and not a personal one.

If you used ABAP_CLOUD_DEVELOPMENT_3TIER, you should
Disable the "Usage of Released APIs" Check.
Enable the "Check for Enhancement Technology".

In every case you need to activate the "Kernseife: Usage of APIs" Check.

Congratulations, you are now able to use the Kernseife ATC Check.
